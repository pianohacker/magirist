# Magirist

Magirist is a recipe manager that focuses on the flow of cooking. Rather than just plain text,
recipes in Magirist show the flow of ingredients and what's happening in parallel.

## Traditional Recipes

Traditional (longform) recipes have a few big problems:

* Parallel steps are awkward, with a lot of language needed to describe what is getting done to
  what. 

  "Okay, so I whisk the eggs and cheese, does the pasta need to be done before then?"

* Your attention has to bounce back and forth between steps and ingredients.

  "The spices are next... how much cinnamon? Oh, a tablespoon..."

* Skimming familiar recipes for the high-level flow is time-consuming.

  "I know most of this, but when do I add the evaporated milk?"

However, they have a few strengths that shouldn't be lost:

* They can detail the _why_ of a step; what makes it important.
* They can give fine detail on a single step, when technique is critical. 

## Prior Art

http://cookingforengineers.com presented the first good solution to this:

This format can't teach you a new recipe but is fantastic for following a complex recipe, especially under
pressure. 

The two dimensions show important pieces of a recipe; ingredients are combined vertically as the
recipe moves through time horizontally. This grouping of ingredients shows up in the lists of most
good recipes, but is rarely well separated or used to its full potential. For example, in the recipe
above, it's clear that the marsala wine has nothing to do with soaking the ladyfingers. 

The division between groups also shows what steps can happen in parallel, and when they have to be
ready for each other. In the tiramisu above, we can see that the ladyfingers don't need to be ready until the custard is ready. 

There are some issues:

* These diagrams are (seemingly) made by hand, and only exist for recipes on the
  cookingforengineers.com site.
* They're static, with no way to react to the progress of a recipe.
* The prose of the recipe is disconnected from the diagram; they can't be used at the same time.

## Main Goals

These diagrams are a great starting point, but need some changes to be a part of a coherent cooking
tool (most important first):

* The diagrams should be a primary focus, allowing the user to step through of the flow of the
  recipe with connections to and from the prose steps.
  * However, they should still make sense without interaction, to work in print and e-ink. 
* They should exist for every recipe in the system, with minimal effort. Ideally, they'd be
  autogenerated; this would reduce tedium and allow importing recipes from elsewhere.
* They should scale to the largest and most complex recipes; they only become useful for lengthy,
  branching recipes, so they have to fit well there.

As a cooking tool in general, it would be nice if Magirist had the following:
* Search by ingredient, for either
  * recipes that DO use some ingredients, for pantry meals and such, or
  * recipes that DON'T, for picky eaters or food allergies.
* Scaling and metric/imperial conversion
  * Even better would be weight/volume conversion.

All of these exist elsewhere, though, and are secondary to making a great visual recipe viewer.
